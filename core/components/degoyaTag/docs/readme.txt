A custom Tag template variable field type for MODX Revolution (2.8.4+).
Use as an alternative to the 'Tag' TV field type, especially useful when you like to hide the input and allow only predefined tags.
 
Features
This custom MODX Revolution TV is based on the original MODX Tag TV but displays only the tags to select from and no inputfield to enter them.

Installation
Install Package via MODX Package Management.
Then simply create a new TV with the input type & output type set to degoyaTag. 
That's it, have fun!
